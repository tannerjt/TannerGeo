Joshua likes solving hard puzzles and challenges.  Originally wanting to be a photojournalist for
National Geographic, he found his calling for geography and computer science in college.  Although
pictures are worth a million words, he believes maps and computer visualizations are the future
of communicating complex data and patterns.  He's worked in government for over 10 years, launched a
mapping startup, and provided consulting for complex software development projects.  He is a proud father / husband, and enjoys running, hunting, and fishing.
